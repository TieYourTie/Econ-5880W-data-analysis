# Research Question & Motivation

### Question
Do higher housing supply elasticities cause housing supply and, consequently, housing prices to respond more strongly to monetary policy changes?

### Motivation
- Strong precedence for analyzing housing supply using elasticities in the literature
- Lack of empirical work on monetary policy and housing supply

# Motivation in Theory

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm]
\node (rate) [box] {Interest Rate $\downarrow$};
\node (borrowing) [box, right of= rate, xshift = 3cm] {Cost of Borrowing $\downarrow$};
\node (costs) [box, right of=borrowing, xshift=3cm] {Investment $\uparrow$};
\node (demand) [box, below of=borrowing, yshift=-0.5cm] {Housing Demand $\uparrow$};
\node (permits) [box, below of= costs, yshift = -0.5cm, draw = red] {Permits/Housing Starts $\uparrow$};
\node (supply) [box, below of = permits, yshift = -0.5cm] {Housing Supply $\uparrow$};
\node (price) [box, xshift = 5.5cm, yshift = -4.5cm] {Price?};

% Arrows
