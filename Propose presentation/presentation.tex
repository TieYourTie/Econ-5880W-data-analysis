\vspace{-1.5cm}
\begin{block}
{Question} How does the outcome of the 2021 Canadian federal election influence voters' trust and satisfaction with democracy, particularly in relation to whether their preferred party secured electoral victory?
\end{block}

\textbf{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The instability of the U.S. democratic system caused by President Trump shows that democracy is not as indestructible as people expect.
    \item Although statistical methods are commonly used in political science research but limit to simplified model. 
\end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Electoral Winner-Loser Hypothesis:} Voters who supported the winning party in an election tend to express greater satisfaction democracy compared to those who supported a losing party.
        \item []
        \item \textbf{Political View Alignment Hypothesis:} Voters whose political views align with the winning party in an election tend to be more satisfied with democracy than those whose views do not.
